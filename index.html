        Spain, officially the Kingdom of Spain, is a country in Southwestern
        Europe with territories in North Africa. Featuring the southernmost
        point of continental Europe, it is the largest country in Southern
        Europe and the fourth-most populous European Union member state.
        Spanning across the majority of the Iberian Peninsula, its territory
        also includes the Canary Islands, in the Eastern Atlantic Ocean, the
        Balearic Islands, in the Western Mediterranean Sea, and the autonomous
        cities of Ceuta and Melilla, in Africa. Peninsular Spain is bordered to
        the north by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; to the east and
        south by the Mediterranean Sea and Gibraltar; and to the west by
        Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. Spain's capital and largest city is
        Madrid, and other major urban areas include Barcelona, Valencia,
        Seville, Zaragoza, Málaga, Murcia and Palma de Mallorca.

        In early antiquity, the Iberian Peninsula was inhabited by Celts,
        Iberians, and other pre-Roman peoples. With the Roman conquest of the
        Iberian peninsula, the province of Hispania was established. Following
        the Romanisation and Christianisation of Hispania, the fall of the
        Western Roman Empire ushered in the inward migration of tribes from
        Central Europe, including the Visigoths, who formed the Visigothic
        Kingdom centred on Toledo. In the early eighth century, most of the
        peninsula was conquered by the Umayyad Caliphate, and during early
        Islamic rule, Al-Andalus became a dominant peninsular power centred on
        Córdoba. Several Christian kingdoms emerged in Northern Iberia, chief
        among them Asturias, León, Castile, Aragon and Navarre; made an
        intermittent southward military expansion and repopulation, known as the
        Reconquista, repelling Islamic rule in Iberia, which culminated with the
        Christian seizure of the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada in 1492. The dynastic
        union of the Crown of Castile and the Crown of Aragon in 1479 under the
        Catholic Monarchs is often considered the de facto unification of Spain
        as a nation state.
